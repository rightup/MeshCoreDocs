## Hardware Prerequisites

To use MeshCore, you need LoRa-compatible devices. MeshCore supports various boards such as Heltec V3, RAK4631, Xiao S3 WIO, and others. These devices can function as clients, repeaters, or room servers according to your needs.

### Supported Frequencies

MeshCore operates on the 868MHz and 915MHz LoRa frequency bands, depending on your region. Be sure to configure the appropriate frequency for your location.

## Number of Devices Needed

You can start using MeshCore with just one compatible device:

### With One Device

Flash the BLE Companion firmware and use your device as a client. You can connect to the device using the Android client via Bluetooth (iOS client will be available later). This allows you to communicate with other MeshCore users near you.

### With Two Devices

There are two common setup scenarios:

1. **If there are few MeshCore users nearby**: Flash both devices with BLE Companion firmware to communicate with your nearby friends and family.

2. **If there are other MeshCore users nearby**: Flash one device with BLE Companion firmware, and flash the other device with repeater firmware. Place the repeater in an elevated position to extend your MeshCore network's reach.

### With More Devices

With additional devices, you can set up room servers to enhance your network's capabilities for persistent messaging and off-grid communication.

## Initial Setup

After flashing the firmware, you need to configure the frequency for your region:

### For Repeaters and Room Servers

1. Connect the device to your computer via USB
2. Access the web flasher's console function
3. Set the frequency with the command:

```bash
password {new-password}
```

Replace `{frequency}` with the appropriate value for your region (e.g., `868000000` for Europe or `915000000` for US/Australia).

This step is essential to enable remote administration of the repeater or room server via RF.
